# WorkFlow
* Press **Connect** on the top left corner. (The button with VS logo)
* Choose **Devtopia** from the list and then press ok.
* By Default the repo is **ps-data-reviewer**, you can choose a different one within the ArcGISPro org.
* Go to devtopia.esri.com and generate a token (Settings->Personal Access Tokens :: Generate New Token)
* Copy the token and paste it in the empty text space in the app next to the word **Token**. It will then presist and you don't have to put it in everytime you use the app.
* Press **Load Milestones** and the app will load all the repository's milestones that have issues and by default pick the current milestone. (the one which has the closest due date).
* You can choose a different milestone by picking it in the drop down menu.
* By default the tasks will be all selected. (pressing on one of the tasks in a place other than the checkbox will check that task and uncheck all others).
* Once you select all the tasks you want, make sure you've selected the desired type of report (its recommended to use MSF for Agile Report).
* Press **Create** on the top left corner. And then you'll be able to zoom in/out and print the cards.
